# Frequently Asked Questions

## General

### How do I log in?
Use your email address and password provided by your administrator.

### What if I forget my password?
Contact your system administrator. An Administrator can generate a password reset link from the **Users** page (Reset Password) and share it with you. The link expires in 24 hours.

### Can I change my password?
Yes. After logging in, open the user menu (your name, top right) and choose **Change Password**. Enter your current password, then your new password (min 6 characters) and confirm it.

### How do I log out?
Use the user menu (your name, top right) and select the logout option. For security, log out when you finish on shared or public computers.

### Why was I logged out automatically?
The system logs you out after a period of inactivity for security. Log in again to continue; consider changing your password if you are concerned about account security.

### How do I get help in the app?
Press **?** (question mark) from most pages for context-sensitive help, or click **Help** in the navigation menu. Help content is organised by section (Getting Started, Roles, Modules, Analytics, Security, FAQ).

## Roles and Permissions

### What user roles exist?
The system has **Administrator (Admin)**, **Sales**, **Operations**, **Finance**, and **Management**. Your role determines which menu items and features you see and what you can edit or delete.

### Why can't I see a menu item or feature?
Menu items and features are shown based on your role. For example, **Users**, **Audit & Security**, and **Tally Export** are only available to certain roles. If you need access, contact your administrator.

### Why can't I edit or delete something?
Editing and deleting are restricted by role. For example, only Admin can delete users or customers (when the customer has no projects); only Finance can edit payment tracking; Sales can edit only their own customers and projects. Check the module help for your role’s permissions.

## Navigation

### How do I navigate between modules?
Use the top navigation menu. Available options depend on your user role.

### What is the Dashboard?
The Dashboard provides an overview of key metrics and information relevant to your role (KPIs, charts, Quick Access tiles). Each role sees a different dashboard (Sales, Operations, Finance, Management/Admin).

### What are the Dashboard filters (FY, Quarter, Month)?
Use the filter bar at the top of the Dashboard to focus on a period. **Financial Year (FY)** is always available; **Quarter** and **Month** are available when exactly one FY is selected. Tile counts and most charts respect these filters.

### What are Quick Access tiles on the Dashboard?
Quick Access tiles show counts (e.g. leads, open deals, payment status) and link to the **Projects** page with the same date filters (FY, Quarter, Month) plus the tile’s filter already applied. Click a tile to open a filtered project list; use **Clear All** on Projects to remove filters.

## Customers

### How do I create a customer?
Go to **Customers** (Customer Master) and click **New Customer**. Fill in name (or first/last for individuals), address, at least one contact number, and other optional details. Sales and Admin can create customers; Sales see **My Customers** and **All Customers** (view-only for others’ customers).

### Who can edit or delete customers?
Sales can edit their own customers (My Customers); Admin can edit any customer and delete customers who have no projects. Management can edit and change salesperson assignment but cannot create or delete.

## Projects

### How do I create a new project?
Click **New Project** on the Projects page. You must **select a customer** first (search by name, ID, or consumer number); if the customer doesn't exist, create them from **Customers** (Customer Master) first. Fill in required fields (Segment, Project Type, Confirmation Date, etc.) and click **Create**. Sales and Admin can create projects.

### How do I update project status?
Navigate to the project detail page and update the status in the appropriate section.

### Can I upload documents to projects?
Yes, use the **Key Artifacts** (documents) section on the project detail page to upload and categorize files.

### Why don't dashboard and project filters match?
Dashboard filters (FY, Quarter, Month) apply to dashboard tiles and most charts. When you open **Projects** from a Quick Access tile, those filters are passed to the Projects page. If you set different filters on the Projects page, they are independent until you click a dashboard tile again or use **Clear All**.

## Support Tickets

### How do I create a support ticket?
Navigate to a project and use the Support Tickets section to create a new ticket.

### How do I add follow-ups to tickets?
Open the ticket and use the "Add Follow-up" option in the ticket detail drawer.

### Can I close tickets?
Yes, if you have the appropriate permissions (Sales, Operations, or Admin). Once closed, only Admin can add follow-ups. You cannot create tickets for projects in **Lost** status.

## Data & Reports

### How do I export data?
Use the export buttons available in various modules. For financial data, use **Tally Export** (Finance and Admin only). Customers and other modules may offer Excel or CSV export where your role has permission.

### Where is Tally Export and who can use it?
**Tally Export** is in the top menu. Only **Finance** and **Admin** can access it. You can export Projects, Invoices, or Payments in Excel, CSV, or Tally XML format. Optional date filters and a confirmation step apply; exports are monitored.

### Can I filter data?
Yes, most modules include filter options (e.g. status, FY, Quarter, Month on Dashboard and Projects; Sales Person, My/All on Customers) to help you find specific data.

### How do I search?
Use the search bar available in most modules to search across relevant fields (e.g. customer name, ID, or consumer number on Customers; customer or project on Projects).

## Users and Security (Admin)

### Where do I manage users?
Administrators use the **Users** page (top menu) to create users (email, name, password, role), view all users, **Reset Password** (generates a 24-hour link to share with the user), and delete users. Only Admin can access this page.

### What is the Audit & Security page?
**Audit & Security** (Admin only) shows login and audit activity: summary tiles (e.g. failed logins, successful logins), Security insights charts, recent failed logins, and an Activity timeline of audit logs. You can export logs as CSV, PDF, or signed PDF for compliance.

### How do I export audit logs? (Admin)
Go to **Audit & Security**, set the date range and filters in the **Activity timeline** section, then use **Export CSV**, **Export PDF**, or **Signed audit export**. The signed PDF includes a footer with date and exporter email for official use.
