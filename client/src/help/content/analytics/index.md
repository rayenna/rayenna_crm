# Analytics and Reports

## Overview

The Analytics section provides insights into your business performance through the Dashboard. The Dashboard is your main analytics view: it shows role-specific metrics, Quick Access tiles that link to filtered project lists, and charts such as revenue by financial year, project value by segment, and more.

## Dashboard Filters

Use the filter bar at the top of the Dashboard to focus on a specific period. All KPI tiles, Quick Access counts, and most charts respect these filters.

- **Financial Year (FY)** – Select one or more financial years (e.g. 2024-25). Format is April to March.
- **Quarter** – Available only when exactly one FY is selected. Options: Q1 (Apr–Jun), Q2 (Jul–Sep), Q3 (Oct–Dec), Q4 (Jan–Mar).
- **Month** – Available only when exactly one FY is selected. Options run from April to March in FY order.

If you select multiple FYs, Quarter and Month are disabled. Use **Clear Filter** (or clear the FY selection) to reset and see all data.

## Role-Based Dashboards

Each role sees a different dashboard layout and set of metrics.

## Quick Access Tiles

**How to use**
1. Set FY (and optionally Quarter or Month) on the Dashboard.
2. Click a tile to open Projects with those filters and the tile’s filter already set.
3. On the Projects page, use **Clear All** to remove all filters and see the full list.

Hover over a tile to see “View projects” before clicking.
