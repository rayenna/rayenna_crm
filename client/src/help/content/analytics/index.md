## Quick Access Tiles

### Overview

Quick Access tiles appear on every dashboard below the main metrics. They show key counts (e.g. leads, open deals, payment status) and link directly to the Projects page with matching filters applied. This lets you jump from a summary number to the filtered project list in one click.

Tile counts respect the dashboard filters (FY, Quarter, Month). When you click a tile, the Projects page opens with those same filters plus the tile-specific filter (e.g. status, payment status).

### How to Use Quick Access Tiles

1. **View a count** – Each tile displays a number for the current filter period.
2. **Click a tile** – You are taken to the Projects page with filters already set.
3. **Use Clear All** – On the Projects page, click "Clear All" to remove all filters and see the full list.
4. **Dashboard filters** – Set FY, Quarter, or Month on the dashboard before clicking a tile; the Projects page will use those filters too.

### Tiles by Role

- My Leads, My Confirmed Orders, Site Survey Stage, Proposal Stage, My Open Deals

**Operations**
