# Analytics and Reports

## Overview

The Analytics section provides insights into your business performance through the Dashboard. The Dashboard is your main analytics view: it shows role-specific metrics, Quick Access tiles that link to filtered project lists, and charts such as revenue by financial year, project value by segment, and more.

## Dashboard Filters

Use the filter bar at the top of the Dashboard to focus on a specific period. All KPI tiles, Quick Access counts, and most charts respect these filters.

- **Financial Year (FY)** – Select one or more financial years (e.g. 2024-25). Format is April to March.
- **Quarter** – Available only when exactly one FY is selected. Options: Q1 (Apr–Jun), Q2 (Jul–Sep), Q3 (Oct–Dec), Q4 (Jan–Mar).
- **Month** – Available only when exactly one FY is selected. Options run from April to March in FY order.

If you select multiple FYs, Quarter and Month are disabled. Use **Clear Filter** (or clear the FY selection) to reset and see all data.

## Role-Based Dashboards

Each role sees a different dashboard layout and set of metrics.

- **Sales** – Year-on-Year summary (capacity, pipeline, revenue, profit), Quick Access tiles, Projects by Stage chart, Revenue by Lead Source, Pipeline by Lead Source, Project Value by Segment (pie), Pipeline by Customer Segment, Project Value and Profit by FY, Customer Profitability word cloud.

## Quick Access Tiles

Quick Access tiles appear on every dashboard (below the main metrics or at the top for Operations). Each tile shows a count for the current filter period (FY, Quarter, Month) and links to the Projects page with the same date filters plus the tile’s filter (e.g. status or payment status) applied.

**How to use**
1. Set FY (and optionally Quarter or Month) on the Dashboard.
2. Click a tile to open Projects with those filters and the tile’s filter already set.
3. On the Projects page, use **Clear All** to remove all filters and see the full list.

Hover over a tile to see “View projects” before clicking.
