# Leads Module

## Overview

The Leads module helps you track potential customers and sales opportunities from initial contact through conversion.

## Understanding Leads

Leads are potential customers who have shown interest in your products or services but have not yet become confirmed customers.

## Lead Status

Leads progress through various stages:
- **Lead**: Initial contact or inquiry
- **Site Survey**: Site visit scheduled or completed
- **Proposal**: Proposal sent to customer
- **Confirmed**: Customer has confirmed the order

## Managing Leads
