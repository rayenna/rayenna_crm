You are a senior QA automation engineer.

This is a production React + Vite CRM deployed on:

Frontend: https://rayenna-crm-kappa.vercel.app

Backend: Render

DB: Neon

File uploads: Cloudinary

I want you to:

Install Playwright as a dev dependency

Create a minimal but production-ready Playwright test suite

Add tests for:

App load

Login (use existing valid test credentials)

Dashboard load after login

Customers page load

One non-destructive document upload sanity test

Create:

playwright.config.ts

tests/auth.spec.ts

tests/dashboard.spec.ts

tests/customers.spec.ts

tests/upload.spec.ts

Use best practices:

Base URL config

Headless mode

Screenshots on failure

No hard-coded secrets in code

Ensure tests run with:

npx playwright test


Do NOT break existing code or configs.

After generating files:

Show me exactly which files were created or modified

Explain how to run tests in Cursor terminal

Highlight where I should update test user credentials

Keep everything FREE and local-friendly.
